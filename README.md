[Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/) is an API service for contact forms. This example also uses [hCapthca](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) to validate human input.

Run `npm install`, then replace the Web3Forms key `CONTACT_FORM_ACCESS_KEY` in the `astro.config.mjs` file with your own key.
After that, simpy run `npm run dev` and navigate to `/contact` or use the button on the homepage to navigate there.
